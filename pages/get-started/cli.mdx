 ### IN PROGRESS

 <Callout type="info">
 I've just added a convenient feature and I'll start working on it. 
 This CLI is designed to handlethe manual steps in the [installation](https://www.rehook.dev/get-started/installation), making things smoother for you. 
 Instead of manually dealing with it, you can just run the CLI and let it take care of everything from the installation to the configuration.
