 <Callout type="info">
 I've just added a convenient feature and I'll start working on it: a custom Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. 
 This CLI is designed to handle a specific step in the process, making things smoother for you. 
 Instead of manually dealing with it, you can now just run the CLI and let it take care of everything.
