# Rehook

<h3 className="mt-4 text-xl font-normal text-gray-400">
A collection of custom and reusable hooks designed to streamline your development process by eliminating the need 
to repeatedly implement the same hooks across different projects.

<h2 className="font-bold text-2xl mt-8">It's not a library or a package to install.</h2>

<h3 className="mt-8 font-bold text-lg">What do you mean by not a library or a package?</h3>


<h5 className="mt-4">

Instead of installing it as a dependency via npm, you'll directly integrate it into your project. 

Choose the hook you require, then simply copy and paste the corresponding code into your project. 

From there, you have full control to customize it to suit your specific needs. 

This approach empowers you with ownership and flexibility, enabling you to modify, delete, or expand the code as necessary.

    I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

  This project is written in TypeScript. I recommend using TypeScript for your projects as well. Create a folder named <code>hooks</code> inside your project and pick a hook from this <a href='https://github.com/alamenai/rehook/tree/main/src/hooks'>list</a> that solves your problem, then import it inside your component. That's it!
